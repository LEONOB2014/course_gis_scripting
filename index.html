# Introduction to GIS scripting
## Python introduction

INBO workshop, 9/11 May 2017

class: center, middle

# Setup working environment

---

# Setting up a working environment

* Working on JupyterHub [1]:

  * Log in at http://lifewatch.inbo.be/jupyterhub
  * Start a Terminal: `New` (upper right) > `Terminal`

* Working on your own laptop with Anaconda [2]

---

# Getting the course materials

* With using git ([1] and recommended for [2])

  First time (inside a terminal or cmd):

  ```
$ git clone https://github.com/stijnvanhoey/course_gis_scripting.git
$ cd course_gis_scripting
  ```

  Updating (on second day):

  ```
  $ git pull
  ```

* Without git for [2]: download ZIP from https://github.com/stijnvanhoey/course_gis_scripting (green button "Clone or download")

---

# Create an environment with Anaconda (for [2] only)
(*make sure you have a working internet connection*)

Use our [environment.yml](https://github.com/stijnvanhoey/course_gis_scripting/blob/master/environment.yml) file inside the course folder to set up your Python working environment

In a terminal or cmd, navigate to the `course_gis_scripting` folder and use the following command:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

---

# Create an environment with Anaconda (for [2])
(*make sure you have a working internet connection*)

When the environment is installed, activate the environment inside the terminal/cmd:

* Windows-users
```
$ activate gispython
```

* Linux/Mac-users
```
$ source activate gispython
```

---

# Starting a Jupyter Notebook (for [2])

* In the terminal, navigate to the `course_gis_scripting` directory if not there already

* Ensure that the correct environment is activated.

* Start a jupyter notebook server with

  ```
$ jupyter notebook
  ```

  This will open a browser window automatically.

When you see something like this...

# Working with python

class: left, middle

## It is just plain text... 

--

## ...until you run it!

---

## (I)python console

**Interactive mode**: It functions like an *advanced calculator*, <br>executing one command at a time:

<br>
.center[![:scale 75%](./img/ipython.png)]

---

## Python scripts

**Scripting mode**: Executing a series of commands saved in text file, with a `.py` extension after the name of your file. 

.center[![:scale 75%](./img/script.png)]

---

## Interactive Development Environment (IDE)

Provides an environment to combine **Interactive mode** and <br> **Scripting mode**

.center[![:scale 55%](./img/spyder.png)]

<div class="alert alert-info">
<a href="https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/">Spyder</a> is the familiar environment for Matlab/Rstudio-users.
</div>

---

## Jupyter Notebook

**Jupyter notebook** provides an **interactive** scripting environment,<br> ideal for exploration, prototyping, tutorials,...<br>

.center[![:scale 70%](./img/notebook.png)]

<br>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
Comparable to Rmarkdown

## Intermezzo!

# And many more tools

**Performance**: Numba, Numexpr, Theano, Cython ...

**Visualisation**: Bokeh, Seaborn, Altair, Plotly, Mayavi, HoloViews, ...

**Data structures and (parallel/distributed) computation**: Xarray, Dask, Distributed, ...

**Packaging and distribution**: pip/wheels, conda, Anaconda, Canopy, ...

Feel free to ask me advice/support on the use of new packages!

# Why Python?

---
class: center, middle

# Python is...

---

## …OPEN SOURCE
* No license costs!

---

## …WIDESPREAD
* Large world-wide community ensures **fast development**
* Used in **scientific** and non-scientific institutes <br> (Google, NASA, ESRI, VMM,...)
* Python is a standard in **GIS** <br> (commercial and non-commercial tools)
* **Multiplatform** (linux, windows,…)

---

## …READABLE

.center[
```
It's easy to learn, easy to read and fast to develop
```
]
<br><br><br>

---

## …REPRODUCIBLE

.center[

instead of
```
what did you/I clicked a few months ago?’-style WYSISYG
```
]

---

## …MULTI-FUNCTIONAL

* Research and development: the python *scientific ecosystem*
* Daily use: great as ductape/glue
* **Automation** of returning tasks

---

## …SO WHAT? The Holy Grail ? No!
* Commercial packages give specific support  and more direct help-functions (cfr. MATLAB, ArcGIS)
* Commercial packages can be more client-friendly
* For hard numercrunching stuff, NOT the fastest solution
* Fortran, C++ etc are also ‘widespread’, so python is just a language amongst the others
* Risk of getting lost in the forest/flood of ‘useful packages’

###Reading advice

[Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00037v1.pdf)

> "*However, while most scientists are careful to validate their laboratory and field equipment, most do not know how reliable their software is*"
