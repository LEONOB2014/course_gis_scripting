# Introduction to GIS scripting

INBO workshop, 9/11 May 2017

Stijn Van Hoey

class: center, middle

# Setup working environment

---

# Setting up a working environment

* Working on JupyterHub [1]:

  * Log in at http://lifewatch.inbo.be/jupyterhub
  * Start a Terminal: `New` (upper right) > `Terminal`

* Working on your own laptop with Anaconda [2]

---

# Getting the course materials

* With using git ([1] and recommended for [2])

  First time (inside a terminal or cmd):

  ```
$ git clone https://github.com/stijnvanhoey/course_gis_scripting.git
$ cd course_gis_scripting
  ```

  Updating (on second day):

  ```
  $ git pull
  ```

* Without git for [2]: download ZIP from https://github.com/stijnvanhoey/course_gis_scripting (green button "Clone or download")

---

# Create an environment with Anaconda (for [2] only)
(*make sure you have a working internet connection*)

Use our [environment.yml](https://github.com/stijnvanhoey/course_gis_scripting/blob/master/environment.yml) file inside the course folder to set up your Python working environment

In a terminal or cmd, navigate to the `course_gis_scripting` folder and use the following command:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

---

# Create an environment with Anaconda (for [2])
(*make sure you have a working internet connection*)

When the environment is installed, activate the environment inside the terminal/cmd:

* Windows-users
```
$ activate gispython
```

* Linux/Mac-users
```
$ source activate gispython
```

---

# Starting a Jupyter Notebook (for [2])

* In the terminal, navigate to the `course_gis_scripting` directory if not there already

* Ensure that the correct environment is activated.

* Start a jupyter notebook server with

  ```
$ jupyter notebook
  ```

  This will open a browser window automatically.

# Introduction Python

---
class: center, middle

# Why python?

---
class: center, middle

# Python is...

---

## …OPEN SOURCE
* No license costs!

---

## …WIDESPREAD
* Large world-wide community ensures **fast development**
* Used in **scientific** and non-scientific institutes <br> (Google, NASA, ESRI, VMM,...)
* Python is a standard in **GIS** <br> (commercial and non-commercial tools)
* **Multiplatform** (linux, windows,…)

---

## …READABLE

.center[
```
It's easy to learn, easy to read and fast to develop
```
]
<br><br><br>

---

## …REPRODUCIBLE

.center[

instead of
```
what did you/I clicked a few months ago?’-style WYSISYG
```
]

---

## …MULTI-FUNCTIONAL

* Research and development: the python *scientific ecosystem*
* Daily use: great as ductape/glue
* **Automation** of time-consuming returning tasks

---

## ...SO WHAT? The Holy Grail ? No!
* Commercial packages give specific support  and more direct help-functions (cfr. MATLAB, ArcGIS)
* Commercial packages can be more client-friendly
* For hard numercrunching stuff, NOT the fastest solution
* Fortran, C++ etc are also ‘widespread’, so python is just a language amongst the others
* Risk of getting lost in the forest/flood of ‘useful packages’

# Working with python

---

## Ipython console

<br>
.center[![:scale 75%](./img/ipython.png)]

---

## Interactive Development Environment (IDE)

* [**Spyder**](https://pythonhosted.org/spyder/) is shipped with Anaconda. The familiar environment for Matlab/Rstudio-users...
* [**PyCharm**](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/): Popular for web-development and Django applications, powerful when doing 'real' development (packages, libraries, software)
* [Eclipse + **pyDev plugin**](http://www.pydev.org/): If you like working in Eclipse, just add the python environment
* ...

## Jupyter Notebook
<small>(*previously called IPython notebook*)</small>

**Jupyter notebook** provides an **interactive** scripting environment,<br> ideal for exploration, prototyping,...

# Overview of today (first day)

Remainder of the morning:

* Getting to know the Jupyter notebook
* Introduction to Python
* Introduction to scientific Python (numpy, pandas)

Afternoon:

* Introduction to GIS-ecosystem in Python
* Geopandas/shapely
* Pick your case:
    - Case study: implementing NICHE
    - Case study: mapping invasive species
    - Case study: Sentinel2 data usage

###Reading advice

[Good Enough Practices in Scientific Computing](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.00037v1.pdf)

> "*However, while most scientists are careful to validate their laboratory and field equipment, most do not know how reliable their software is*"
